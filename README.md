# Future Studies Masters

I am beginning to embark on a self-taught Masters in Future Studies. From a few
days of literature search, it seems that *future studies* breaks down into two
general approaches:

1. Attempting to accurately predict the future
2. Planning for the various future scenarios without caring to predict a
   specific one

Which approach you'll want to use depends on your goals in learning future
studies. If you care about predicting the future for its own sake (or making
money in prediction markets), you'll need to solve 1; if you're planning as a
business, investment firm, policymaker, etc., then you can solve the easier
problem of 2.

My personal interest here is in both 1 and 2, and my proposed curriculum below
will reflect that. So here we arrive at the question

> How do I significantly improve my skills in 1 and 2?
