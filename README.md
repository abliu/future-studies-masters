# Future Studies Masters

I am beginning to embark on a self-taught Masters in Future Studies. From a few
days of literature search, it seems that *future studies* breaks down into two
general approaches:

1. Attempting to accurately predict the future
2. Planning for the various future scenarios without caring to predict a
   specific one

Which approach you'll want to use depends on your goals in learning future
studies. If you care about predicting the future for its own sake (or making
money in prediction markets), you'll need to solve 1; if you're planning as a
business, investment firm, policymaker, etc., then you can solve the easier
problem of 2.

My personal interest here is in both 1 and 2, and my proposed curriculum below
will reflect that. So here we arrive at the question

> How do I significantly improve my skills in 1 and 2 over the span of a
> semester?

## The Curriculum

I would propose the following curriculum:

1. Set up a **prediction market** with a few friends who are interested in this
   stuff (or a [prediction
   registry](http://www.davidbrin.com/predictionsregistry.html) with myself in I
   don't have such friends).
2. Make **20 initial bets** in this market, spaced out across
   exponentially increasing timeframes. Use my brains and any data or facts I
   have to look up, and feel free to develop my own framework or methods for
   making bets, but do not look at existing future studies methods. To reflect
   approaches 1 and 2 above, half of the bets should be of the form `X will be
   true of the world at time Y` and the other half should be of the form `If I
   did X today, then given scenarios Y1, ..., Yn at time Z, I would achieve goal
   W`. (If I am just interested in tech investing, I might choose my bets to be
   relevant to that, such that the second type of bet will always look like `If
   I invest in X1, ..., Xn, then given scenarios Y1, ..., Yn, I would achieve
   high returns`.) See [here](https://workflowy.com/s/lVNwzkgPTt) for my
   progress in this area.
3. After making the initial bets, begin the learning phase of mixing my thought
   processes and knowledge with that of successful futurists:

   a. **Acquire field vocabluary**: Choose a list of 20 futurists to study based
   on mentions of notability (see
   [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-best-living-futurists),
   [HowStuffWorks](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/future-tech/10-groundbreaking-futurists.htm#page=10),
   and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_futurologists)),
   affiliated institutions and customers, and diversity of fields and ideas.
   Determine the main bets and methods of each of these futurists.

   b. **Acquire field methods**: Create a contingency graph of the
   [Houston](http://houstonfutures.org/courses.html)
   [curriculum](http://www.uh.edu/technology/programs/graduate/foresight/) (see "Breakdown" below),
   Wendell Bell's book, Richard Slaughter's book, The Good Judgment Project, and
   prediction market sites (e.g. InTrade and
   [Marketocracy](http://www.marketocracy.com/), Hamming). Choose an initial learning
   path through the graph to acquire 3 methods (either off-the-shelf or modified
   for personal use), and use them for making another 20 bets in the prediction
     market.

   c. **Bombard self with ideas**: Read 10 articles on [Hawaii Futures Publications
   list](http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications.html) or
   [Technovelgy](http://www.technovelgy.com/), subscribe to 3 blogs
   of the notable futurists selected in 3a, and read 1 book (e.g. of the
   Edge.org type or [Theory of
   Everything](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Everything-Integral-Business-Spirituality/dp/1570628556) type).
   From these new ideas, derive another 20 bets.

   d. Repeat 3b and 3c for an increasing number of methods and ideas.
